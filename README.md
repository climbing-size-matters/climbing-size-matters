# Climbing Size Matters

Have you ever looked at a route on Mountain Project, and had to search
for what gear was recommended to protect the route? And then you don't
even have a red Alien, so you have to figure out what size your gear
is that could act as a substitute?

This is a browser extension that helps improve the UX on Mountain Project
to highlight gear and translate to your gear.

## Usage

Load a route page on Mountain Project (e.g.

This extension should change the page's content.

Right now, it just highlights the mentions of gear and crack size different colors:
