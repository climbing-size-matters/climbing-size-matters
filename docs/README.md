### Why a docs folder?

Normally we would use a [Github wiki](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/adding-or-editing-wiki-pages),
but unfortunately those are only available for public repos or Github Pro accounts.

So while we're private and not Pro, we'll just have to add docs to our codebase.
